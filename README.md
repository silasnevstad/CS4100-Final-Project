## Predicting Football Performance using Machine Learning<br><sup>Northeastern CS4100</sup><br><sup>Silas Nevstad, Ryan Monahon, Kedaar Chakankar</sup>

This repository contains the code for our final project for CS4100. The goal is to compare the effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting football performance based on team statistics. The code includes a web scraper to scrape from  [fbref.com](https://fbref.com/en/). 

To install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the model:
```bash
python model.py
```

To scrape data (already scraped in `data/` folder):
```bash
python data_scraper.py
```
